This demo, spongycastle-eclipse, is just the simplest possible example of how to use Spongy Castle within an Eclipse project - it's not meant to be an interesting app! 

I find setting up Spongy Castle in Eclipse pretty simple, but I might be making some assumptions that are worth documenting... the spongycastle-eclipse demo app was prompted by a question on StackOverflow:
